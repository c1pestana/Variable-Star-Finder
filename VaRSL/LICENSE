Side note from the author of VaRSL:

This is merely to insure credit for the VaRSL is present if it--or its structure or something obviously derivative of its stucture--is used by
a company in their software. If a student is to use this code for their research, I grant them full access to allow them to modify as they see
fit. Furthermore, students and professors using VaRSL CAN credit me for my code, but it will not be enforced or expected of from me. 

On that note, if a student or professor from any university stumbles upon this code and uses it for their project, I would LOVE to hear about 
the research VaRSL is being used for, and I will help out with setting the code up and navigating it in any way that I can.
